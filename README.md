Native Android Apps Examples - Java
===================================

### When I was learning native Android app development, I had created this repository.

In these examples, I have tried to implements the customization of android default widgets/components.

**I have tested and run these code in Android Jelly Bean, read more [https://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean].**

So if you try to run these example now (I mean 2023 or later), you may face several problems. To avoid these problems follow my below advise...

  - Setup your andorid studio
  - Create new app from Android Studio file menu
  - Copy the code/file from my repository
  - Paste it into your newly created project
  - Then run your project using emulator or real device


**Device is mandatory to learn the App development**. 

### That's it
